# Exercise 1: Binary Search Implementation
"""
Implement a binary search algorithm that searches for a target value in a sorted array.
Return the index of the target if found, otherwise return -1.

Example:
Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], target = 7
Output: 6 (index of target in the array)
"""

def binary_search(arr, target):
    # Your implementation here
    pass

# Exercise 2: Bubble Sort Implementation
"""
Implement the bubble sort algorithm to sort an array in ascending order.
Return the sorted array.

Example:
Input: arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
Output: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]
"""

def bubble_sort(arr):
    # Your implementation here
    pass

# Exercise 3: Object-Oriented Programming
"""
Create a class 'BankAccount' with the following:
- Properties: account_number, holder_name, balance
- Methods: deposit(amount), withdraw(amount), get_balance()

Ensure that:
- The balance can't go below zero
- The deposit and withdraw methods handle invalid inputs
"""

class BankAccount:
    # Your implementation here
    pass

# Exercise 4: Stack Implementation
"""
Implement a Stack data structure with the following methods:
- push(item): Add an item to the top of the stack
- pop(): Remove and return the top item from the stack
- peek(): Return the top item without removing it
- is_empty(): Return True if the stack is empty, False otherwise
- size(): Return the number of items in the stack
"""

class Stack:
    # Your implementation here
    pass

# Exercise 5: Recursion - Factorial
"""
Implement a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number.
Remember that factorial(n) = n * factorial(n-1) and factorial(0) = 1.

Example:
Input: 5
Output: 120 (5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120)
"""

def factorial(n):
    # Your implementation here
    pass
